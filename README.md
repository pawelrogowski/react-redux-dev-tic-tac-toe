**Tic Tac Toe Game**

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React Redux with Redux-toolkit. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbol on the board until one player wins or the board is filled.

This project was created as a learning attempt to practice refactoring a Tic Tac Toe game using React state hooks to use redux state store. As such, it may not be optimized for production use and may contain bugs or issues. I welcome any feedback or suggestions to help improve the code and my understanding of React.
